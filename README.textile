h2. In2EverNote

This is a utility webapp written using the Play! framework, scala, and the LinkedIn developer APIs
and the EverNote APIS to save important shares from connections on LinkedIn.

The app also uses scribe-java to handle the oauth flow, and is deployed to Google App Engine.

* Be sure to edit ApiKeys.scala and fill in the apiKey and secretKey you obtain from http://developer.linkedin.com, otherwise the app won't work*

h3. Installation

Note: I couldn't get play idealize to work well, so instead created only the Eclipse .classpath and .project files.

Note: You need to get your API keys from http://developer.linkedin.com
and edit the ApiKeys.scala file.

This has garbage values which will fail to compile currently.

h4. Running

This is a Play 1.1.1 app with GAE 1.4 and Scala 0.8 -- other combinations seem unstable 
or run into problems trying to deploy to tomcat or gae.

play run In2EverNote

then go to http://localhost:9000

h4. Deployment

The app is deployed to Google App Engine using:

play gae:deploy --gae=/users/dragade/GAE/appengine-java-sdk-1.5.1
